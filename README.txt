Goals
- Have a standardised way to integrating Funnelback search results with popular mapping services with minimal customisation.
- Provide a default set of Freemarker macros to handle map presentation.
- Provide flexibility in the choice of mapping service (eg. Google Maps vs. OpenStreetMap vs. Bing Maps) with minimal changes to code
- Provide the ability to use custom pins, info boxes and pin clustering.
- Provide a GeoJSON endpoint that can be accessed by other services
